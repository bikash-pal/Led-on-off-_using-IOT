# Led-on-off-_using-IOT
Led was connected to net and was controlled using Mobile Phone. 
This code works fine in ESP8266 NodeMCU WiFi Board using Arduino IDE.

Connect an LED to D1 pin of the board and upload the code. Use this webapp https://iot-tinkering.000webhostapp.com/ to control the LED. You can hook a relay instead of LED to control electrical devices like bulbs & fans.
